The following is a sample of projects created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find

_Four Main Graphs have been visualized and dataset was checked for any null values present. The null values were subsequently dropped from the data set. The conclusion derived from the data is that the most popular car for the past three decades (1984 to 2017) are sub-compact, compact, and mid size cars. More than 4,000 cars of this class are sold during this period. BMW is the most popular make among these cars. BMW sub-compact, compact, and mid size cars were found to mostly use premium fuel and lastly, annual cost of owning a compact car may be lower than sub-compact or mid-size car_

## Project 02

In this project, _I explored Interactive plot, Spatial Visualization and Linear regression. The original dataset is grouped by with the help of the group_by() function and a new sub-dataset is created. The library of plotly is used to create an interactive graph which is much more visually appealing. 
For Spatial visualization, geom_sf() is used and the "broom" library is used to tidy up the dataset and the linear regression is plotted._ 

Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

## Project 03

In this project, I explored dataset for Tampa Weather Data. _The main task of Part 1 was to recreate six graphs which makes use of faceting and ridges. The numeric columns of "month" was converted into written characters, the function as.factor is made use of which returns the original object of a class with the requested column specified as a factor rather than numeric_


**Density plot with faceting** 

_Density Plot_
The initial step is to convert the numeric columns of "month" into written characters, the function as.factor is made use of whose main function is to return the original object of a class with the requested column specified as a factor rather than numeric.

### Moving Forward

_As a beginner studying Data visualization, I learnt a lot regarding the design principles, ggplot, grammar of graphics, spatial visualization, interactive plots, reproducible research etc and it helped me improve my coding skills. I intend to keep learning and practising on different datasetsmoving forward_
